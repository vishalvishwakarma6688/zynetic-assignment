Project Assignment: High-Scale Energy Ingestion
Engine
Target Role: Backend Developer (Node.js/NestJS)
Experience Level: 2+ Years
Time Limit: 48 Hours
1. Executive Summary
Our Fleet platform manages a high-scale ecosystem of 10,000+ Smart Meters and
EV Fleets. To provide intelligence to Fleet Operators, we consume two independent
data streams that arrive every 60 seconds from every device.
The goal of this assignment is to build the core ingestion layer that handles these
streams, correlates them, and provides fast analytical insights into power efficiency
and vehicle performance.
2. Domain Context: Hardware & Logic
To build a successful system, you must understand the relationship between the two
hardware sources:
● The Smart Meter (Grid Side): Measures AC (Alternating Current) pulled
from the utility grid. It reports kwhConsumedAc, representing the total energy
the fleet owner is billed for.
● The EV & Charger (Vehicle Side): The charger converts AC power into DC
(Direct Current) for the battery. The vehicle reports kwhDeliveredDc (actual
energy stored) and SoC (State of Charge/Battery %).
● Power Loss Thesis: In the real world, AC Consumed is always higher than
DC Delivered due to heat and conversion loss. A drop in efficiency (e.g.,
below 85%) indicates a hardware fault or energy leakage.
3. Functional Requirements
A. Polymorphic Ingestion
Create a robust ingestion layer that recognizes and validates two distinct types of
telemetry arriving via 1-minute heartbeats:
● Meter Stream: { meterId, kwhConsumedAc, voltage, timestamp }
● Vehicle Stream: { vehicleId, soc, kwhDeliveredDc, batteryTemp, timestamp }
B. Data Strategy (PostgreSQL)
Implement a database schema optimized for write-heavy ingestion and read-heavy
analytics. Demonstrate the separation of:
● Operational Store (Hot): Fast access for "Current Status" (SoC, active
charging).
● Historical Store (Cold): Optimized storage for billions of telemetry rows over
time.
C. Persistence Logic: Insert vs. Upsert
Choose the correct operation for each data "temperature":
● The History Path: An append-only (INSERT) approach for every granular
reading to build an audit trail for long-term reporting.
● The Live Path: A strategy (UPSERT/Atomic Update) ensuring the
dashboard avoids scanning millions of rows to find a car's current battery
percentage or a charger's last known voltage.
D. Analytical Endpoint
Implement GET /v1/analytics/performance/:vehicleId returning a 24-hour summary:
● Total energy consumed (AC) vs. delivered (DC).
● Efficiency Ratio (DC/AC).
● Average battery temperature.
4. Technical Constraints
● Framework: NestJS (TypeScript).
● Database: PostgreSQL.
● Performance: The analytical query must not perform a full table scan of the
historical data.
5. Deliverables
1. Source Code: A GitHub repository link.
2. Environment: A docker-compose.yml to spin up the service and DB.
3. Documentation: A README.md explaining your architectural choices
regarding data correlation and how the system handles 14.4 million records
daily.
